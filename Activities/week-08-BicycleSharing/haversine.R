#' Find the distance between two points on the Earth's surface
#' 
#' Specify the location of the points by latitude and longitude.  The calculation is done
#' under the assumption that the Earth is a sphere of radius 6371 km, using the Haversine formula. The 
#' distance calculated is a great-circle distance on a sphere.  This will be accurate within 10s of miles for 
#' points in distant parts of the Earth.  For points that are nearby (say, in the same city) the accuracy is much better, meters.

#' @param lat1 Latitude of the first point
#' @param lon1 Longitude of the first point
#' @param lat2 Latitude of the first point
#' @param lon2 Longitude of the first point
#' @param Radius The radius of the sphere.  Whatever are the units of \code{Radius} will be units of the distance. Default: 6371 km, the radius of the Earth.
#' 
#' @return a single number giving the distance.  The units in which the distance is expressed is the same as \code{Radius}.
